# functional-variant-prediction
A machine learning pipeline using Catboost to predict functional variants.

## ðŸ“¦ Environment Setup

This project uses **Conda** to manage dependencies. Follow these steps to set up your environment.

###  1. Install Conda
If you donâ€™t have Conda installed, download and install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

###  2. Create the Environment
Run the following command in your terminal to create the Conda environment:

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
## ðŸš€ Usage

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for training and evaluating a **CatBoost Classifier** with **Bayesian hyperparameter optimization**. Follow these steps to run the pipeline:

###  1. Prepare Your Environment
Ensure that you have set up the Conda environment as described in the [Environment Setup](#-environment-setup) section.

Activate the environment:
```sh
conda activate catboost_ml
```
